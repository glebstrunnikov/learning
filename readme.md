This repo consists of the code I've made for training purposes.

Files in the "references" folder are not supposed to be looked into, they're there for me to check out a specific topic just in case. A bunch of copypasted examples, commented out code, notes and other garbage only for me to figure out.

Files in the "projects" represent, well, projects made by me from scratch. Some info here:

- Wordle analyzer is a sctipt which defines the best opener (first word) for the Russian version of the wordle (https://wordle.belousov.one/). You'd never guess it yourself btw!
- Weather API widget is a simple app that compares the weather in the place of your choice to where you're currently situated in.
- Calories Tracker is pure js app which tracks what you eat, it can save products&ccal, load them, archive by days and so on.
- putinPooper is a game I made as an assignment from my joker mentor, it's a simple thing with one button, but its main feature was that I should figure out how to run a Node Express server with a SQLite DB on it communicating to the front. I really need to come up with a better name (and story)
- Coach Finder is an app which is not really interesting and unique, but it's relatively complicated amd uses most of the features Vue3 provides.
- There's also a bunch of microprojects I don't want to dive deeply into.
